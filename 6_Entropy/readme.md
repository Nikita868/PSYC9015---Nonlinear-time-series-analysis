The main functions are provided by Nonlinear Analysis Core, Center for Human MovementVariability, University of Nebraska at Omaha. Here is the [link to their github](https://github.com/Nonlinear-Analysis-Core/NONANLibrary) but in some cases were modified by me (noted below).

This is a list of the included functions and the full name of the methods.

- **Ent_Samp** - Used to calculate the Sample Entropy of a time series.
- **Ent_Symbolic**, Used to calculate the Symbolic Entropy of a time series.
- **Ent_Permu**, Used to calculate the Permutation Entropy of a time series using a log of base 2.
- **Ent_MS_Plus**, Used to calculate the Refined Composite Multiscale Sample Entropy, Composite Multiscale Entropy, Multiscale Entropy, Multiscale Fuzzy Entropy, and Generalized Multiscale Entropy of a time series.
