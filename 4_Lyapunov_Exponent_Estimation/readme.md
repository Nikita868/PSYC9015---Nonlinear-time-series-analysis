The main functions are provided by Nonlinear Analysis Core, Center for Human MovementVariability, University of Nebraska at Omaha. [link to their github](https://github.com/Nonlinear-Analysis-Core/NONANLibrary) but in some cases were modified by me (noted below).

This is a list of the included functions and the full name of the methods.

- **LyE_R** - Calculates the Largest Lyapunov Exponent using the method published by Rosenstein et al. (1993).
- **LyE_W_NK** - Calculates the Largest Lyapunov Exponent using the method published by Wolf et al. (1985). Modified by Nikita to include visualization of trajectories.
- **Ch4_LyE_estimation_Wulf.m** - Example code for applying Wulf's algorithm in various time series (damped sine, Lorenz, hip joint angle during walking).
- **Ch4_LyE_estimation_Rosenstein.m** -  Example code for applying Rosensteing's algorithm in various time series.
- **A4_LyE_hip_data.mat** - sample time series of hip joint angle in sagittal plane during walking on a treadmill. Sampling rate 60Hz.
