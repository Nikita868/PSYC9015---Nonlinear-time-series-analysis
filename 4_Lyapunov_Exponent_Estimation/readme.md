The main functions are provided by Nonlinear Analysis Core, Center for Human MovementVariability, University of Nebraska at Omaha. [link to their github](https://github.com/Nonlinear-Analysis-Core/NONANLibrary) but in some cases were modified by me (noted below).

This is a list of the included functions and the full name of the methods.

- **SSR_lecture_code** - code to accompany the powerpoint slides on state space reconstruction.
- **comet3_2** - is equivalent to standard matalab comet3, but implements a pause in the drawing such that the trajectory evolves slower.
- **AMI_Stergiou** - this is a histogram-based method of Average Mutual Information that is used to find a time lag using average mutual information for state space reconstruction.
- **AMI_Thomas** - this is a kernel density-based method of Average Mutual Information that is used to find a time lag for state space reconstruction.
- **ChaosLibrary** - this uses a number of systems of differential equations that can be used to create chaotic attractors.
- **FNN** - calculates an embedding dimension for state space reconstruction using the method of False Nearest Neighbors.
